This program contains a raw implementation of Adaboost, Random Forest and KNN for extracting picture orientation. 
The input data used was a set of 28x28 pixel images each labeled with its correct orientation.
This mini project is simply a try to implement Adaboost, Random Forest and KNN Algorithms. The best accuracy achieved was 72.08%.
